# Test Code for pygame.

This Pygame unittest code is a short Python script that checks the Pygame library's functionality. It typically initializes Pygame, creates a simple game window, and might involve basic interactions like moving a character or handling user input. The purpose is to ensure that Pygame is correctly installed and configured, allowing developers to test essential features before building more complex games. It serves as a foundational step, confirming that the Pygame environment is set up properly for further game development



## To execute the test.

"To execute the test code, follow these steps:

 - Download and install any type of code editor. 
 - Download the audio, font, graphics, main_game.py and test_main_code.py files and place them in the same directory. 
 - Open the folder in your code editor containing the game files.
 - Run the game_code.py file, and don't forget to close the game when you're done."

A test code is like a quality check for software. It's a set of instructions written by developers to automatically verify if a piece of software, like an app or a game, behaves the way it's supposed to. Imagine it as a safety net â€“ when new features are added or changes are made, these tests quickly run to catch any mistakes or problems. They help ensure that the software continues to work correctly and that new changes don't accidentally break anything. In simple words, it's a way to make sure our software does what it's supposed to do without introducing unexpected issues.
