# Project Title

Title: "CSF Pygame Project."\
Description: "This project marked the initial step in learning to develop games with the assistance of a freely provided game engine from Pygame."


##  Introduction

 "It is my first experience in game development with the help of the Python library called Pygame. I created a simple game with guidance from a YouTube tutorial, in which the character runs and jumps over snails, and as you survive longer, your score increases. This project marked my first encounter with the Pygame library, helping me improve skills related to using Pygame's built-in functions and providing a better understanding of how classes work in Pygame."
## To play the game

"To play the game, follow these steps:

 - Download and install any type of code editor. 
 - Download the audio, font, graphics, and game_code.py files and place them in the same directory. 
 - Open the folder in your code editor containing the game files.

 - Run the game_code.py file, and don't forget to close the game when you're done." 
## Documentation of the game.

"This game can serve as a valuable reference for beginners working on game development projects. It encompasses well-defined game development steps, including creating a display screen, adding characters using rectangles, integrating images and audio, simulating natural phenomena like gravity, and implementing classes. Additionally, it aids programmers in organizing the sequence of their code.\

You can find a helpful YouTube tutorial on how to build this type of game at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk."
